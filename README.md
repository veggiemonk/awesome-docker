> A curated list of Docker resources and projects
Inspired by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)' [awesome][sindresorhus] and improved by these **[amazing contributors](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/graphs/contributors)**.

It's now a GitHub project because it's considerably easier for other people to edit, fix and expand on Docker using GitHub. Just click [README.md][editREADME] to submit a [pull request][editREADME].
If this list is not complete, you can [contribute][editREADME] to make it so.

> **Please**, help organize these resources so that they are _easy to find_ and _understand_ for new comers. See how to **[Contribute](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)** for tips!

#### *If you see a link here that is not (any longer) a good fit, you can fix it by submitting a [pull request][editREADME] to improve this file. Thank you!*

The creators and maintainers of this list do not receive and should not receive any form of payment to accept a change made by any contributor. The goal of this repo is to index articles, learning materials and projects, not to advertise for profit. **All pull requests are merged by default** and removed if inappropriate or unavailable, or fixed when necessary.

# What is Docker ?

> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.
